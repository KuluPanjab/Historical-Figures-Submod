FRIEDRICHWILHELMIII;Friedrich Wilhelm III succeeded to the throne on 16 November 1797. He ruled Prussia during the difficult times of the Napoleonic Wars. Lenient and slow to recognize the growing French threat, Friedrich Wilhelm's restrained entry into the war in 1806 ended in defeat and humiliation for the nation. Following Napoleon's defeat, he took part in the Congress of Vienna, which assembled to settle the political questions arising from the new, post-Napoleonic order in Europe. His primary interests were internal – the reform of Prussia's Protestant churches. He was determined to unify the Protestant churches to homogenize their liturgy, organization, and architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRIEDRICHWILHELMIIIDEATH;Our beloved sovereign Friedrich Wilhelm III was found dead in his quarters of a fever that had lasted for days. He will be buried in the Mausoleum in Schlosspark Charlottenburg, Berlin. His eldest son, Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, will succeed him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRIEDRICHWILHELMIV;On the death of his father, Friedrich Wilhelm IV becomes the new King of Prussia. Through a personal union, he also becomes the sovereign prince of the Principality of Neuchâtel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
PRINCEWILHELMREGENCY;It is no secret that King Friedrich Wilhelm IV is in poor health. For some time now, he has suffered from several strokes that have left him partially paralysed and mentally disabled. As he has no living descendants, his brother - and presumptive heir - Wilhelm has been designated as regent until he recovers, however, this is an almost zero chance of happening, and he is already preparing to assume the throne very soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
FRIEDRICHWILHELMIVDEATH;After years suffering from the ills of successive strokes, King Friedrich Wilhelm, increasingly gloomy and isolated from the public eye, was in the presence of his subjects when he suffered another stroke and died in the Sanssouci palace. According to his testamentary instructions, he will be buried with his wife in the crypt under the Peace Church in Sanssouci Park in Potsdam, and his heart removed from his body and buried alongside his parents in the Charlottenburg Palace mausoleum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
WILHELMICORONATION;On the death of his brother Friedrich Wilhelm IV, Prince Wilhelm ascended the throne as Wilhelm I of Prussia in Schlosskirche. Later, thousands of people gathered in front of the courtyard of Königsberg Castle to celebrate the coronation, the date of which honours the anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig. Considered more open and receptive to certain liberal ideas, in a short speech he again proclaimed a “New Era” of liberalism in Prussia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
