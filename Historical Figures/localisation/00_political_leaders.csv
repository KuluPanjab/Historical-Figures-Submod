FRIEDRICHWILHELMIII;Friedrich Wilhelm III ruled Prussia during the difficult times of the Napoleonic Wars. The king reluctantly joined the coalition against Napoleon in the Befreiungskriege. Following Napoleon's defeat, he took part in the Congress of Vienna, which assembled to settle the political questions arising from the new, post-Napoleonic order in Europe. His primary interests were internal – the reform of Prussia's Protestant churches. He was determined to unify the Protestant churches to homogenize their liturgy, organization, and architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches in the Prussian Union of Churches. The king was said to be extremely shy and indecisive. His wife Queen Louise was his most important political advisor. She led a mighty group that included Baron vom Stein, Prince von Hardenberg, Gerhard von Scharnhorst, and Count von Gneisenau. They set about reforming Prussia's administration, churches, finance, and military.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In January 1858, Wilhelm became Prince Regent for his brother, initially only temporarily, but after October, when it became clear to everyone that the king's situation would not change, permanently. Against his brother's advice, William took an oath on the Prussian constitution and promised to preserve it "solid and inviolable.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

William refused to comply with his brother's wish, expressed in Frederick William's last will, that he should abrogate the constitution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
